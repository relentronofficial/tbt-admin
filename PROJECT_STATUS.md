## Known Issues / Pre-Existing Bugs

1. `admin-panel/app/admins/create/page.tsx` — TypeScript errors on `contactNumber` and `dateOfBirth` fields (pre-existing, not introduced)
2. `backend/src/modules/notifications/controller.ts` — TypeScript errors (pre-existing)
3. `useUpdateCourseEpisode` hook URL uses `/api/courses/episodes/${id}` but the actual route is `/episodes/:eid` — mismatch in pre-existing hook, not changed
4. Content Sections PRD mentions "Episodes (if not linked to Course): add/edit episode list inline" — this requires a `ContentItemEpisode` schema that doesn't exist in Prisma. Not implemented.
